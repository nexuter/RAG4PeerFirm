CTCNA was engaged by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), in its capacity as certificate administrator and custodian, to perform certain specified servicing functions identified in the assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation reports. Wells Fargo engaged CTCNA in connection with the sale of Wells Fargo’s corporate trust services business to CTCNA and its affiliates. Further, under the principles-based definition of “servicer” set forth in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB that looks to the functions that an entity performs, this party is a “servicer” for the purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)). | 179 | 185 | 364 |

As a result, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association is a “servicer” as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 10% or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants’ attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index. | 94 | 88 | 182 |
| Item 1122 | Situs Holdings, LLC is the special servicer of the 1633 Broadway Mortgage Loan and the 525 Market Street Mortgage Loan.

Therefore, the Depositor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria for Situs Holdings, LLC and an accountants’ attestation report pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB because Situs Holdings, LLC is servicing more than 5% of the pool assets. However, the Depositor is not required to include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a servicer compliance statement pursuant to Item 1123 of Regulation AB of Situs Holdings, LLC because Situs Holdings, LLC is an unaffiliated servicer servicing less than 10% of pool assets. | 28 | 31 | 59 |
| Item 1123 | With respect to the pari passu loan combinations that include the 245 Park Avenue Mortgage Loan, the 85 Broad Street Mortgage Loan and the IC Leased Fee Hotel Portfolio Mortgage Loan,(i) the report on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria and attestation report on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria of BellOak, LLC as operating advisor of the 245 Park Avenue Mortgage Loan on and after December 14, 2022 listed on the Exhibit Index are omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the reasons set forth in the Explanatory Notes above; and (ii) the servicer compliance statements of Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association as special servicer of the 85 Broad Street Mortgage Loan and the primary servicer and special servicer of the IC Leased Fee Hotel Portfolio Mortgage Loan, listed on the Exhibit Index are omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K as they are not required by Item 1123 of Regulation AB to be included on this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is an unaffiliated party that is not a “servicer” that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB. | 4 | 6 | 10 |
